### How to run
- Question 2
    - Enter the `hw2-q2` folder.
    - Add the `utils.py` and `Kuzushiji-MNIST.npz` files which were provided as base material.
        - `Kuzushiji-MNIST.npz` can be downloaded via the `download_kuzushiji_mnist.py` script.
    - Run `hw2-q2.py` with the desired parameters, or, to get all the outputs needed for the report, run the `run.sh` script (`./run.sh`).
- Question 3
    - Enter the `hw2-q3` folder.
    - Run `hw2-q3.py` (use the flag `--use_attn` to run with the attention layer), or, to get all the outputs needed for the report, run the `run.sh` script (`./run.sh`).
